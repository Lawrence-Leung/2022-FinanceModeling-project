# A Strategy Design and Abnormal Transaction Identification Model for High-Frequency Trading

## üèÜ Project Introduction

Welcome to our project repository! Here is a collection of our work that **won the first prize in the third "Greater Bay Area Cup" Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Financial Mathematical Modeling Competition for University Students in November 2022** - **"A Strategy Design and Abnormal Transaction Identification Model for High-Frequency Trading"** .

This project aims to provide effective decision support for stock market trading through innovative high-frequency trading strategies and abnormal trading identification models.

## üìà Summary

In this project, we focus on high-frequency trading (HFT) ‚Äî an electronic trading method that uses the high-speed computing power of computers to profit from extremely short-term market changes. Our research mainly focuses on the Chinese stock market, by applying a variety of high-frequency trading strategies to improve the returns of specific stock portfolios, while integrating an abnormal event detection system to adapt to diverse application scenarios.

Main tasks include:

1. Use the entropy weight method-TOPSIS and the three-factor comprehensive evaluation method to screen out the stocks most suitable for high-frequency trading.
2. Construct a classification and prediction model based on CNN neural network to optimize trading decisions.
3. Calculate and analyze the 21-day cumulative return and maximum drawdown rate of the selected stocks.
4. Set up an early warning mechanism for abnormal transactions to deal with situations such as price limit and reduction of holdings by major shareholders, e.g., Everbright Securities.

## üìò Contents of this Repository

This repository contains the following content:

- Full paper (written in Chinese): Detailed description of our research methods, data analysis, model construction and results.
- Source code: including complete code for data processing, model training and prediction.

Notice:

- The data set cannot be made public due to copyright protection of the organizer of "Greater Bay Area Cup" competition.
- The size of a single file of some source codes exceeds 25MB, so we package all single files exceeding 25MB in the corresponding directory into `OVERSIZED_DATA.zip` and its sub-volumes. The compressed package needs to be decompressed to the **same directory** as the compressed package so that the corresponding source codes can be used normally.
